# Troubleshooting WorkIQ

Use this reference when a WorkIQ tool call fails or behaves unexpectedly.

## Both `workiq` and `workiq-preview` installed side-by-side

**Symptom:** Both the stable `workiq` and the `workiq-preview` plugins are installed and you're unsure which is being used, or behavior changes between sessions.

**Cause:** Both plugins can be installed simultaneously — they register different MCP server names (`workiq` and `workiq-preview`), so their tools appear under different prefixes (`workiq-*` vs `workiq-preview-*`). However, **both binaries share the same `~/.workiq` config file** regardless of which channel they came from (see "Conflicting WorkIQ binaries / versions share one config file" below).

**Fix:** It's safe to have both installed for testing purposes, but:

- Decide which one you want the model to use and prefer tools with that prefix.
- If you only need one channel, uninstall the other to remove ambiguity:

  ```powershell
  copilot plugin uninstall workiq-preview
  # …or
  copilot plugin uninstall workiq
  ```

- Be aware that config changes (auth, scopes, defaults) made by one will be seen by the other.

## Same plugin name from different marketplaces (`workiq@copilot-plugins` vs `workiq@microsoft`)

**Symptom:** Documentation, skill triggers, or guidance differ from what someone else on your team sees, even though "WorkIQ is installed" for both of you.

**Cause:** Multiple marketplaces publish a plugin called `workiq` (for example `workiq@copilot-plugins` and `workiq@microsoft`). These are **different skill packages** that all point at the same underlying MCP server (`@microsoft/workiq`). Tool behavior is identical, but skill prompts, trigger phrases, and references may differ.

**Fix:** Check exactly which package is installed:

```powershell
copilot plugin list
```

If the wrong one is installed, uninstall it and install the intended one by its fully qualified name:

```powershell
copilot plugin uninstall workiq
copilot plugin install workiq@microsoft
```

## Conflicting WorkIQ binaries / versions share one config file

**Symptom:** Config changes made with one `workiq` binary appear to be lost, ignored, or unexpectedly applied when a different `workiq` is invoked. Common after switching between a globally-installed `workiq` and the `npx`-on-demand binary used by the MCP server, or between stable and preview versions.

**Cause:** All WorkIQ binaries — regardless of how they are installed (`npm i -g`, `npx -y @microsoft/workiq`, the MCP server's own `npx` invocation, stable vs. preview) — read and write the **same config file** under the user's home directory. A newer or older binary can mutate config in ways that break other versions.

**Fix:**

1. Decide which installed plugin you want to use, and uninstall the others (see the "Both `workiq` and `workiq-preview` installed side-by-side" section above).
2. If you have a globally installed `workiq` (`npm ls -g @microsoft/workiq`), make sure it is current (`@latest`).
3. If config looks corrupted or out of sync, reset it and re-consent:

   ```powershell
   workiq config list
   # Inspect, then if needed:
   workiq config reset
   workiq auth consent --scopes <scopes you need>
   ```

## Tool name not found

**Symptom:** A call to `ask`, `fetch`, etc. fails with "tool does not exist" or similar.

**Cause:** Your MCP host exposes the tool under a prefixed name derived from the **MCP server name** (`workiq-preview`), not the logical name documented in the skill.

**Fix:** Scan your available-tools list for an entry whose name **ends with** the logical name (e.g., `ask`). In Copilot CLI the prefixed form is `workiq-preview-ask`; in Claude Desktop it's `mcp__workiq-preview__ask`. Call the exact prefixed name your host requires.

## Entity tool returns "not enabled" or "experimental feature disabled"

**Symptom:** Calls to `search_paths`, `fetch`, `get_schema`, `create_entity`, `update_entity`, `delete_entity`, `do_action`, or `call_function` fail with an error indicating the feature is not enabled or is experimental.

**Cause:** Entity tools are gated behind an experimental flag in the WorkIQ CLI configuration.

**Fix:** Enable experimental features once per machine, then restart the Copilot CLI session:

```powershell
workiq config set experimental=true
```

After enabling, retry the original tool call.

## Entity tool returns a 400 / "bad request" on a Graph URL

**Symptom:** `fetch` or another entity tool returns HTTP 400 with a parser or validation error.

**Cause:** URL formatting violates the entity tool URL rules.

**Fix:** Verify the URL:

1. Starts with `/me/...` or `/users/...` — no scheme, authority, or `/v1.0`.
2. All query parameter values are URL-encoded (spaces → `%20`, quotes → `%27`, etc.).

See the **URL Format Rules** section of `SKILL.md` for full examples.

## Tool call fails with a `null` / empty response and no error details

**Symptom:** A WorkIQ tool call fails but the response is literally `null` — no status code, no error body, no diagnostic of any kind.

**Cause:** Some backend failures (permission denials, unsupported paths, policy blocks, timeouts) are currently surfaced as a bare `null` response instead of an error message.

**Fix / how to proceed:**

1. Check the request itself first — URL format rules (server-relative path, URL-encoded query values), `jsonBody` string encoding, and that the path/ID is real (no `{id}` literals, no guessed IDs). Fix and retry **once**.
2. If a multi-URL `fetch` failed, retry the URLs individually — one bad URL can fail the batch.
3. If it still fails, **stop retrying**. Do not probe many path variants, other backends, or alternative APIs hunting for a way around it.
4. **Report it honestly:** tell the user which call failed and that the server returned no diagnostic detail. You may suggest possible causes (missing Graph scopes — see the 403 entry below for `workiq auth consent`; unsupported path) only as explicitly unconfirmed hypotheses. **Never state a specific status code or error ("403", "AccessDenied", "Insufficient privileges") that you did not actually observe in a tool response.**

## `search_paths` rejects a `backend` / `source` / `provider` argument

**Symptom:** `search_paths` returns a tool input validation error, or silently ignores extra arguments like `backend: "sharepoint-rest"` / `provider: "dataverse"`.

**Cause:** `search_paths` only accepts `filter` (regex, required) and `agentId` (optional). There is no `backend` parameter and no equivalent — WorkIQ exposes a single catalog of Microsoft Graph paths.

**Fix:** Drop the extra argument and retry with `filter` only. If the user explicitly asked for SharePoint REST, Dataverse, or any other API surface, report honestly that WorkIQ surfaces Graph paths through `search_paths` and the other surface is not available here. Do not invent a tool variant or alternate backend.

## `fetch_blob` or `upload_blob` returns "tool does not exist"

**Symptom:** A call to `fetch_blob`, `upload_blob`, or any variant (e.g. `download_file`, `get_blob`, `put_file`) returns "tool does not exist" — or you cannot find such a tool in your available-tools list.

**Cause:** Binary-content tools are documented for future reference but are **not released in the current WorkIQ MCP surface**. The available tools are `ask`, `list_agents`, `search_paths`, `get_schema`, `fetch`, `call_function`, `create_entity`, `update_entity`, `delete_entity`, and `do_action`. See the deny rule in `SKILL.md`.

**Fix:** Do not retry, do not search for an alternate binary tool, do not invent one.

- For downloads: `fetch` the item's metadata (`/me/drive/items/{id}`) and return the `webUrl` so the user can open and download in OneDrive / SharePoint / Outlook directly.
- For uploads: tell the user WorkIQ cannot send file bytes yet; offer them the destination URL so they can upload via the OneDrive / SharePoint UI.
- For attachments: return the parent message URL so the user can open and download in Outlook.

Never fabricate base64 content or `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` values to satisfy the request.

## `ask` is slow or appears to hang

**Symptom:** A single call to `ask` takes 10–30 seconds.

**Cause:** Expected behavior. `ask` is agentic — it performs multiple backend searches internally.

**Fix:** If you only need a literal list, filter, or known entity, use `fetch` (or another entity tool) instead. Entity tools typically return in under a second.

## `ask` times out around 300 seconds

**Symptom:** `ask` fails with a timeout after ~300 seconds, or repeatedly hits the request time limit on complex questions.

**Cause:** The question is too broad and forces the WorkIQ agent to perform too many internal operations within a single call (e.g., "summarize everything everyone said about every project this month").

**Fix:** Break the question into smaller, more focused sub-questions and let the local model chain the results together. For example, instead of one mega-question, issue several scoped calls (one per person, project, or time window) and synthesize the answers locally. Each sub-question should be answerable in well under the 300s limit.

## Authentication or consent errors

**Symptom:** Tool calls fail with auth, consent, or permission errors.

**Cause:** The WorkIQ MCP server requires tenant admin consent on first use, and the current user must be signed in.

**Fix:** Direct the user to the [Tenant Administrator Enablement Guide](../../../../ADMIN-INSTRUCTIONS.md). For interactive sign-in issues, retry the tool call — the MCP server will prompt for sign-in if needed.

## Sign-in fails or hangs (brokered auth issues)

**Symptom:** Sign-in fails, hangs, or never completes — typically on Windows where WorkIQ first tries the OS authentication broker (WAM).

**Cause:** WorkIQ uses brokered authentication by default and automatically falls back to browser-based login if the broker fails. In some environments (e.g., misconfigured WAM, corporate policy, missing components) both paths can still fail or the broker can hang before the fallback kicks in.

**Fix:** Disable brokered auth so WorkIQ goes directly to browser-based login:

```powershell
workiq config set disableBrokeredAuth=true
```

Then retry the failing tool call or run `workiq auth consent` again.

## HTTP 403 Forbidden on an entity tool call

**Symptom:** `fetch`, `do_action`, `update_entity`, or another entity tool returns `HTTP 403` for a Graph path. Two common flavors:

1. **Missing delegated scope** — error body contains `"Missing scope permissions on the request. API requires one of '<Scope.Name>, ...'"`. Typical examples: editing a channel message requires `ChannelMessage.ReadWrite`; reading another user's calendar requires `Calendars.Read.Shared`.
2. **Insufficient directory privileges** — error body contains `"code":"Authorization_RequestDenied","message":"Insufficient privileges to complete the operation."`. Typical examples: `PATCH /me` to change `jobTitle`, `department`, `officeLocation`, `manager`, or any other directory-managed property -- these are read-only via delegated `/me` scopes and only an admin can write them through the directory.

**Cause:** The current user (or app) does not have the Microsoft Graph permission needed for that operation. By default, WorkIQ only requests a minimal set of scopes; additional scopes must be granted explicitly, and some properties cannot be written by end users at all.

**Do not retry.** A 403 from Graph is **permanent** until consent is granted (or the operation is performed by an admin). Repeating the exact same call returns the exact same 403. The model must stop after the first 403, surface the failure to the user, and either:

- Tell the user the operation isn't permitted with the current consent and suggest the appropriate `workiq auth consent` command (flavor 1), or
- Tell the user the property is directory-managed and an administrator change is required (flavor 2).

**Fix (flavor 1 only):** Run `workiq auth consent` to grant the missing scope, then retry once.

```powershell
# Grant calendar read access
workiq auth consent --scopes Calendars.Read

# Grant multiple scopes at once
workiq auth consent --scopes Mail.Read Calendars.ReadWrite Sites.Read.All

# Channel message editing
workiq auth consent --scopes ChannelMessage.ReadWrite
```

Flavor 2 (`Authorization_RequestDenied` on `/me` directory writes) is **not** fixable by `workiq auth consent` for an end user -- a tenant admin must update the property via the directory.
